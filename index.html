                <h2>A funny story</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time when I was such a young girl attending the university. An embarrassing event
                    happened which I still feel embarrassed every time I remember it.
                    One day I went to the campus and from far away I saw two of my friends (they were very close and
                    always went everywhere together). I ran to them and hugged one of them.
                    But when I looked at the face, I realized I made a mistake and to hide my embarrassment, I jumped to
                    the one next to her and hugged her instead, thinking she must have been the right one.
                    It turned out she was also not my friend. I was so embarrassed that I just wanted to disappear then
                    and there, especially when my real friends were just a few meters away seeing everything.</p>
                <h4>In sort</h4>
                <p>Look carefully before you hug someone!</p>
